This is a Koop provider that uses the Hub API as its data source.

## Streaming All Datasets
This provider plugin currently only supports [streaming](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) ALL datasets matching a given search query. It performs searches using the [`searchContent`](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/search/searchContent/) function from [`@esri/hub.js`](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/) and requests all pages from the API in order.

### Define Search Parameters
To perform a search from an output plugin, attach an [`IContentSearchRequest`](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/api/search/IContentSearchRequest/) to the response.
```js
req.res.locals.searchRequest = {
  options: {
    site: 'my-site.hub.arcgis.com'
  },
  filter: {
    term: 'some search terms'
  }
};
```

### Pull the Readable Stream
Then pass the request object to `this.model.pullStream`.
```js
const docStream = await this.model.pullStream(req);
```

### Full Example
What you have now is a Node.js `Readable` stream. You can pipe the datasets from the readable through a transform stream in order to format them into some other type of output before sending them back to the browser by piping them to the Express.js response. The following simple example also uses the [`through2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/through2) library to conveniently define a transform stream.

```js
async handleRequest (req, res) {
  req.res.locals.searchRequest = { /* some search params */ };

  const docStream = await this.model.pullStream(req);

  docStream
    .pipe(through2.obj(function (dataset, enc, callback) {
      const transformed = someTranformFunc(dataset);

      // the Express.js "res" Writable only accepts strings or Buffers
      this.push(JSON.stringify(transformed));
      callback();
    }))
    .pipe(res);
}
```
